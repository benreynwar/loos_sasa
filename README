Enables calculation of Surface Accessible Solvent Area (SASA) using the LOOS package (http://loos.sourceforge.net/).

To use, the files must be copied into LOOS, appropriate changes make to the installation scripts and LOOS recompiled.

I'm posting them here, mostly so they don't get lost before they are integrated into LOOS.

These files (except MersenneTwister.hpp) were written by Ben Reynwar in 2012, and copyright has been assigned to Alan Grossfield.
